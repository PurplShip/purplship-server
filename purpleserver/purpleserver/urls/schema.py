## API Reference

Purplship is an open source multi-carrier shipping API that simplifies the integration of logistic carrier services.
        
The Purplship API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request
bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Purplship API differs for every account as we release new versions.
These docs are customized to your version of the API.


## Versioning

When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated version is released. 
The current version is `{settings.VERSION}`. 

Read our API changelog and to learn more about backwards compatibility.

As a precaution, use API versioning to check a new API version before committing to an upgrade.
"""

AUTHENTICATION_DESCRIPTION = """
For client-side code, we encourage the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate your app.
The JWT tokens changes for every new session and have an expiration timestamp.

To authenticate via JWT access key, use `-H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAxxx...xxxaS86FjLH6U"`.
